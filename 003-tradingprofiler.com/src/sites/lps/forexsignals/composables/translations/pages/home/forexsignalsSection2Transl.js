        en: `<p>‘Forex trading signal’ may sound incredibly fancy (and pricey) but the reality is quite different. They’re simply a trading tool that provides you with the data you need to make the right decisions at the right time. Companies that offer signals tools (we at ${process.env.VUE_APP_BRAND_TITLE} have our Forex signal tool here) may communicate by SMS, email, IM pop ups etc. although the method varies, the service provided is actually the same. These signals will give you critical information on the current Forex market, letting you know about fluctuations and other conditions that may influence pricing, and provide you with data alongside insights to help you make sensible, critical investment decisions. Depending on the quality of the service provider you choose, they may even offer analysis alongside the data to help simplify the Forex market further for you. Most are subscription services that provide an immediate alert.</p>`,

However, Forex trading signals are a fantastic way to improve your Forex trading skills considerably. Remember that the alerts you receive will give you access to an immense amount of knowledge and support, and by that, they make a great learning tool to guide you through the Forex process and help you improve your skills. The Forex market appears very simple, but in reality there’s a lot of data to process. Signals will give you critical insight into the behaviour of currency pairs, as well as giving you an ‘easy’ start in initiating and trading in Forex. Trading signals are a fantastic way to improve your Forex skills while still keeping your risk as minimal as possible.</p>`,

        en: `<p>Hopefully by now you’re starting to see why we at ${process.env.VUE_APP_BRAND_TITLE} offer this service to our clients. There are a few benefits to using a Forex signal tool to help you make your investment decisions. The live nature of these services is the critical key- you aren’t relying on data that’s already hours out of date, but instead receive alerts ‘as they happen’. You’re also simplifying the information and receiving clear guidance with less research, something that will benefit you immensely if you happen to be a novice trader. This will allow you to focus your attention where it really matters- your Forex account and trades. It’s also a very nice way to slowly introduce yourself to more and more market information and learn more about the trading process, without the need to tie yourself to a desk and then internet like a schoolkid. In effect, you get knowledge at your fingertips, which will allow you to jump into trading immediately while still making knowledgeable decisions, and simply live a trading life that’s less stressful and pressured.</p>
        <p>Overall, Forex signals give you valuable Forex data timeously, while providing a guiding hand to help you make the best possible decisions for your investment account. They’re an excellent tool to make Forex trading a little less stressful and a lot more productive.</p>`,
